    "### Introduction\n",
    "Ice sheet dynamics is central to understanding Earth's history and future, especially given rising global temperatures. Melting of ice sheets contributes directly to sea level changes which has negative impacts on many communities and wildlife. However, the long term dynamics of ice sheet melt and formation, caused by changes in Earth's orbit, have facinating effects. Understanding the long term dynamics well allows us to distinguish expected behavior from abnormal melting. <br>\n",

    "source: https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/earth-science/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/ <br>\n",
    "Milankovich cycles are small perterbations in Earth's orbit that change the total level of sunlight the planet recieves. The main parameters are eccentricity, or the shape of the orbit, obliquity, or the angle of tilt of Earth's axis, and precession, the direction Earth's axis of rotation is pointed. These three variations occur at well known intervals which align with past ice ages, confirmed from ice core data. (Pollard 1982). The main cycles occur in intervals of 20, 40, and 100 kyr. Previous models have captures the 20 and 40 kyr cycles but failed to capture the 100 kyr cycle. The 100 kyr cycle is especially prevelant in Northern Hemisphere ice sheets which is the focus of this paper. \n",

    "##### Boundary Conditions & Initial Conditons\n",
    "To find the boundary conditions, we assume the cross-section of the ice sheet is a rectangle with length  $4889 \\text{ km}$ (the distance between model boundaries of $30 \\degree$ N and $74 \\degree$ N). The height is calculated by dividing the given ice sheet cross-sectional area from Pollard by the length of the ice sheet. When $t = 700$ (700,000 years ago), the ice sheet cross sectional area is $4.5 \\times 10^9 \\text{ m}^2$. Thus the height of the ice sheet is $920.43 \\text{ m}$. Repeating the calculations for the other boundary, at $t = 0$ (present day), the cross-sectional area is $3.5 \\times 10^9 \\text{ m}^2$ so the height is $715.89 \\text{ m}$ "
