    "### Introduction\n",
    "Ice sheet dynamics is central to understanding Earth's history and future, especially given rising global temperatures. Melting of ice sheets contributes directly to sea level changes which has negative impacts on many communities and wildlife. However, the long term dynamics of ice sheet melt and formation, caused by changes in Earth's orbit, have facinating effects. Understanding the long term dynamics well allows us to distinguish expected behavior from abnormal melting. <br>\n",

    "##### Milankovich Cycles\n",
    "source: https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/earth-science/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/ <br>\n",
    "Milankovich cycles are small perterbations in Earth's orbit that change the total level of sunlight the planet recieves. The main parameters are eccentricity, or the shape of the orbit, obliquity, or the angle of tilt of Earth's axis, and precession, the direction Earth's axis of rotation is pointed. These three variations occur at well known intervals which align with past ice ages, confirmed from ice core data. (Pollard 1982). The main cycles occur in intervals of 20, 40, and 100 kyr. Previous models have captures the 20 and 40 kyr cycles but failed to capture the 100 kyr cycle. The 100 kyr cycle is especially prevelant in Northern Hemisphere ice sheets which is the focus of this paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Previous Work\n",
    "There are many models to simulate changing ice sheet levels over time. Oerlemans (1980) proposes a similar nonlinear diffusion model however they include effects of global temperature changes caused by Milankovitch cycles and the effects of changing water levels underneath the ice sheet. Weertman (1976) provides a different method to calculate the accumulation rate of snow on the ice sheet and preforms a stability analysis. The main difference between Pollard (1982) and other ice sheet models is the ability to capture the 100 kyr Milankovitch cycle."

    "### Equations and Parameters\n",
    "The fundamental process being studied is the diffusion of ice sheets over time. The thickness, $H$, of an ice sheet over time can be modeled with a nonlinear diffusion equation:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} = A \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[H^{\\alpha}\\left| \\frac{\\partial(H + h)}{\\partial x}\\right|^{\\beta}\\frac{\\partial(H + h)}{\\partial x}\\right] + G(H + h, x, \\text{orbit})$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$t$: time <br>\n",
    "$x$: distance from northern boundary to spacial step <br>\n",
    "$h$: the elevation of the bedrock surface above a fixed reference level (taken as the present mean sea level) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this model: <br>\n",
    "$A = 5.77\\times10^{-4} \\text{m}^{-3}\\text{yr}^{-1}$<br>\n",
    "$\\alpha = 5$<br>\n",
    "$\\beta = 2$<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "$G$ is the net annual mass balance on the ice sheet surface, depending on snowfall and ice melt, and is given by<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "a(h+h' -E) - b(h+h'-E)^2 & h+h' - E \\leq 1500 \\text{ m} \\\\\n",
    "0.56 & h+h' - E > 1500 \\text{ m}\n",
    "\\end{cases} \\text{     m yr}^{-1} $$\n",
    "where $E$ is defined \n",
    "$$E = E_0(x) + k \\Delta Q$$\n",
    "$k$: insolation sensitivity <br>\n",
    "$E_0(x)$: the present equlibrium line<br>\n",
    "$\\Delta Q$: is the difference in the summer half-year insolation at $55 \\degree$ N from that of the present <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Assumptions\n",
    "Several assumptions were made. The bedrock is assumed to be in isostatic equlibrium meaning the effects of bedrock deformation due to the weight of the ice sheet are not taken into account. As a result we can substitute $h = -rH$ where $r = 0.3$ is the ratio of ice density to rock density. When we make this substitution, the PDE becomes\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} = A(0.7)^{\\beta + 1}  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[H^{\\alpha}\\left| \\frac{\\partial(H)}{\\partial x}\\right|^{\\beta}\\frac{\\partial(H)}{\\partial x}\\right]  $$\n",
    "The equation is formulated such that east-west diffusion is neglected as well, meaning the ice sheet is only changing height in the north-south direction. Further, the function $G$ to model snow accumulation has many simplifications. The equilibrium line $E$ is taken to have constant slope, and the function doesn't incorporate temperature or the amount of water underneath the ice sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Modifications\n",
    "The paper runs the model for the past 700,000 years however due to the method we chose, stability, and time constraints, our code solves the PDE for the past 50,000 years. This is so that the 20 kyr and 40 kyr Milankovich cycles are captured. Further, the paper integrates from 74 N to 30 N, and for similar reasons as the time modifications, our model is evaluated from 74 N to 65 N which is about 1000 km. Due to this change, in the G function, we instead calculate the summer half year insolation compared to a latitude of 68 N. "

    "To find the boundary conditions, we assume the cross-section of the ice sheet is initially a triangle with length  $1000 \\text{ km}$ (the distance between model boundaries of $74 \\degree$ N and $65 \\degree$ N). After adjusting the initial height, we found 920 m to be a reasonable starting point that allowed for stability. <br> <br>\n",
    "The boundary condition at the northern boundary is a no flux Neumann. This is because we want to enforce the dome shape of the ice sheet so the top should have a flat (0) slope. The southern boundary is where the ice sheet meets the ocean so it should be at sea level, so we enforce a Dirichlet boundary with $h=0$."

We decided to use this numerical method because it is easier to implement and it does not require matrix multiplication, which makes it computationally much faster to implement.
